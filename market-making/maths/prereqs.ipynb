    "# Jump Processes [[src](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/nprivault/MA5182/stochastic-calculus-jump-processes.pdf)]\n",
    "A **jump process** $N_t$ is stochastic process whose path is characterized by discrete jumps/changes in value at random interarrival times. Their SDEs produce non-continuous paths as a result of the jumps\n",
    "\n",
    "### Poisson Process\n",
    "The **Poisson process** is a jump process driven by exponentially distributed interarrival times. It counts the total number of jumps that have occured up until time $t$ and follows the poisson distribution with rate parameter $\\lambda t$ where $\\lambda$ is the parameter of the underlying exponential distribution. One important property of the poisson process is that it has independent stationary increments: the number of jumps from time $t$ to $t+s$ is not dependent on the jumps up till time $t$ and it is identically distributed when considering any interval $[t,t+s]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **index of dispersion** of the poisson process (the ratio of variance to mean) is 1. This is relevant in determining whether observed data can be modelled using a poisson process.\n",
