## List of some resources:
    - Python: Python reference/docs online for the packages.
    - C++: The official C++ reference, or learncpp.com. Find some books by Bjarne Stroustrup. (No folder on this since there's way more to cover than python)
    - Youtube channels: 
        - mCoding: for advanced Python concepts
        - MikeShah: For learning C++ from scratch
        - Core dumped, Byte Monk: for general CS
        - CodingJesus: General knowledge
        - CS50 : Basic CS concepts
        - Algomonster : CS concepts
    - Platforms for programming courses:
        - Udemy
        - Coursera
    - Basic/competitive DSA: Neetcode, Leetcode, Codeforces (last resource is kind of overkill)
    - Other areas (their concepts can help solve harder optimization problems):
        - Multi objective optimization
        - Non-linear optimization

# Notes on learning to manipulate data:
- Do competitions and go on practice platforms to do pandas/polars/SQL questions.

## Some tips to getting better at scripting/coding:
- If you've done enough practice with the basics, try doing a big project that incorporates all the concepts you've learnt.
