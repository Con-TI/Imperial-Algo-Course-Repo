Notebooks contain a high-level overview of:
- Algorithmic trading as a whole: (Signals and Execution)
- High frequency trading (Common strategies and optimal execution algorithms)
- Mid frequency trading (Common strategies)
- Quantitative portfolio management (Common strategies)
- Smart order routing (Common strategies)

Sidenote: contents may not be all encompassing and very rough since this is purely from what can be found online by someone not in the industry yet.
