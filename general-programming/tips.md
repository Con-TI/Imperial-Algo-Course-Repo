Some tips to getting better at scripting/coding:
- Leetcode and other online coding platforms for technical assessments and interview questions (build up your pattern recognition and memorise important information regarding specific programming language versions)
- Read and try to contribute to open source projects to practice becoming familiar with new large codebases
- Go through all the super basic algo trading projects (write out an EMA/SMA crossover strategy and other backtests, make an options pricer, etc. just to get used to writing applicable code)
- Once ready, do one large and heavy duty project (not necessarily full-stack). Could be more resesarcher/maths-oriented (finding a research paper and doing some modifications), or developer (write code that beats some benchmark in terms of memory usage or speed).
- Participate in competitions to practice working under time constraints with others
