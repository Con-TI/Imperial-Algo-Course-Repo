    "### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a probability space $(\\Omega,\\mathcal{F},\\mathbb{P})$, where $\\Omega$ is the sample space (set of possible outcomes), $\\mathcal{F}$ is the $\\sigma$-algebra (set of events which are sets of outcomes), and $\\mathbb{P}$ is a **probability measure**. The probability measure $\\mathbb{P}:\\mathcal{F}\\rightarrow[0,1]$ is a function from the $\\sigma$-algebra to the interval $[0,1]$, assigning a probability to every event. It satisfies the following properties:\n",
    "- $\\mathbb{P}(\\Omega)=1$\n",
    "- Given countably many disjoint sets $A_i$, $\\mathbb{P}(\\cup_{i\\in\\mathcal{I}}{A_i})=\\sum_{i\\in\\mathcal{I}}{\\mathbb{P}(A_i)}$\n",
    "- It is non-negative.\n",

    "We can express expectation of a random variable $X$ under probability measure $\\mathbb{P}$ as $\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{P}}[X]=\\int_{\\Omega}X(\\omega)d\\mathbb{P}(\\omega)$. $d\\mathbb{P}(\\omega)$ can be interpreted as the probability of $\\omega$.\n",

    "### Radon Nikodym Derivative\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider two probability measures $\\mathbb{P}$ and $\\mathbb{Q}$ on the same $\\sigma$-algebra. $\\mathbb{Q}$ is *absolutely continuous* with respect to  $\\mathbb{P}$ if $\\mathbb{Q}(A)=0\\implies\\mathbb{P}(A)=0$ (The converse is known as being *singular* w.r.t to $\\mathbb{P}$). **Radon Nikodym's theorem** states that two measures are equivalent if they are absolutely continuous to one another. Given absolute continuity of $\\mathbb{Q}$ w.r.t $\\mathbb{P}$, there exists a function $Z = \\frac{d\\mathbb{Q}}{d\\mathbb{P}}$ called the **Radon Nikodym Derivative** (sometimes the likelihood ratio function) whereby,\n",

    "\\end{array} \n",
    "where $X$ is a random variable. If we treat $\\mathbb{P}$ and $\\mathbb{Q}$ to represent distributions, then the RN derivative is a likelihood ratio between the two (measuring how much more likely something is to occur in $\\mathbb{Q}$ than in $\\mathbb{P}$). As a sidenote, the radon nikodym derivative can also be used to interpret statistical tests (type I errors, type II errors, etc).\n",

    "### Quadratic Variations and Girsanov's Theorem\n",
    "An **adapted process** is any time varying (stochastic or deterministic)process $\\theta_t$ that is dependent only to the information available up to time $t$ (it is non *anticipative*). The **Novikov condition** states that given $X_t$ an adapted process up to time $T$ and the condition $\\mathbb{E}[e^{\\int_0^TX_s^2ds}]<\\infty$, then the process $M_t$ is a martingale (also known as the **exponential martingale**).\n",

    "**Girsanov's theorem** allows us to connect a diffusion process on two different probability measures $\\mathbb{P}$ and $\\mathbb{Q}$ so long as their diffusion coefficients are the same. Given $X_t$ with the SDEs $dX_t=a_1(t,X_t)dt+\\sigma(t,X_t)dW_t^{\\mathbb{P}}$ under $\\mathbb{P}$ and $dX_t=a_2(t,X_t)dt+\\sigma(t,X_t)dW_t^{\\mathbb{Q}}$ under $\\mathbb{Q}$, the Radon Nikodym derivative is given by \n",
