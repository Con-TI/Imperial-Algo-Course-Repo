    "# The Greeks\n",
    "The greeks refer to the various partial derivatives of an option's price with respect to variables like the price of the underlying and volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Delta ($\\Delta$)\n",
    "$\\Delta$ is the sensitivity of an option's price to movements in the underlying, i.e. $\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S}=\\Delta$. Below is an example derivation of $\\Delta$ for a European call option.\n",
    "\\begin{array}{rl}\n",
    "V(t,S_t)&=\\displaystyle S_tN(d_1)-Ke^{-r(T-t)}N(d_2)\\\\\\\\\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S}(t,S_t)&=\\displaystyle \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial S}(S_tN(d_1)-Ke^{-r(T-t)}N(d_2))\\\\\\\\\n",

    "&=N(d_1)\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "Some steps have been skipped above since the expansion of the rest of the partial derivatives is fairly straightforward and they cancel.\n",
    "\n",
    "One main use of delta is for the purposes of delta hedging. This is the strategy of purchasing/selling $x$ units of options contracts and then selling/purchasing its underlying in $\\Delta x$ units. Overall, this can help with things like the variance of your returns, and focusing on predictions for other influences on an options price like volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, a put option's delta must be negative while a call option's delta must be positive. Deep ITM options will tend to have larger delta values. Lastly, ATM options have the most change in delta as the underlying shifts in price (another greek known as $\\Gamma$).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gamma ($\\Gamma$)\n",
    "$\\Gamma$ is the sensitivity of an option's $\\Delta$ to price movements in the underlying, i.e. $\\frac{\\partial\\Delta}{\\partial S}=\\Gamma$. Below is an example of $\\Gamma$ for a European call option.\n",

    "\n",
    "Gamma is relevant for knowing how quickly delta needs to be rebalanced for better hedging. As explained previously, it is highest when an option is ATM and decreases as the underlying moves further away from the strike price. Of note is that it is always positive and the same for both puts and calls. Moreover, the positive nature implies that both european calls and puts are convex functions of the underlying price.\n",

    "\\end{array}\n",
    "It is positive for both european calls and puts since an increase in volatility corresponds to a higher diffusion coefficient and probability of ending ITM.\n",
    "\n",
